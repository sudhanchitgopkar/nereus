        <p>
            Hey there! We're Nereus, a campus-only dating website that matches students, regardless of who they're looking for. We leave behind the clunky chat functions and long questionnaires of other dating apps, priortizing authentic connections through a cohesive social network portfolio. Currently, we're deploying at colleges around the southeast, including UGA, Georga Tech, and GSU!
        <h2> How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Getting started with Nereus is simple! Head over to our <span style="color: #FDAB30;">register</span> page to make an account. Then, you'll add a profile picture, a short bio about yourself, and drop any social media links you want potential matches to visit. Then, you're ready to get matching! Begin by answering a few fun "would-you-rather" questions so that we can use our algorithm to pair you with the best possible matches.
        </p>
        <h2> Meeting Your Matches</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike other dating apps, Nereus lets you take charge of your own matches. Once you've <span style="color: #FDAB30;">signed in</span>, you'll see your top match in the <span style="color: #FDAB30;">browse</span> section along with some other profiles. You'll have the opportunity to see the profile picture, bio, and occupation of your matches. To learn more about them, we've linked their social media profiles in their profile card. Feel free to browse and connect with any of your matches on the platform of your choice!
